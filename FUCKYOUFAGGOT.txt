CentralCoding - The logical pitstop!


CentralCoding.com is a site dedicated to coding, and having fun. Even if you're not a developer, the site has plenty to offer to you, from awards, gaming sections, and even Anime. CentralCoding or CC for short is a brand new forum opened by a friend and I, and we are determined to make this forum blow up. Hop by today, we'll be sure to give you a warm welcome. With various different sections to post in, you'll never be bored! If you don't see something that you'd like to see, clap your hands and stomp your feet until it happens over at our suggestion corner! CentralCoding, where you're the center piece.
